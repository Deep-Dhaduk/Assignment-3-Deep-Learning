## About the Playground

The Neural Network Playground is an interactive visualization tool that lets you build, train, and observe neural networks directly in your browser. It supports multiple architectures and allows hands-on experimentation with key deep learning concepts.

### Key Features

- **Multiple Architectures** – Experiment with standard Neural Networks, CNNs, Transformers, GNNs, Diffusion models, and Design Spaces.
- **Real-Time Training** – Watch the network train live, with epoch count, loss, and accuracy updating in real time.
- **Customizable Inputs** – Choose from input features such as x₁, x₂, x₁², x₂², x₁x₂, sin, and cos.
- **Adjustable Hyperparameters** – Tune the learning rate, activation function, and regularization strength.
- **Flexible Architecture** – Add/remove hidden layers and adjust the number of neurons per layer.
- **Live Decision Boundary Visualization** – See how the network's decision boundary and output evolve during training.
- **Loss History** – Track the training loss over epochs in a live chart.
- **Classification Output** – Visualize how the model separates Class A and Class B data points.
